# 🛡️ Securing Agentic Applications - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This repository provides **practical and actionable guidance** for designing, developing, and deploying **secure agentic applications** powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

It serves as a technical complement to the official **OWASP Agentic AI Threats and Mitigations (ASI T&M)** document, focusing on concrete technical recommendations and implementable security controls that builders and defenders can apply directly.

### Core Security Topics

**Technical Security Controls and Best Practices**  
Specific security controls tailored for agentic systems.

**Secure Architectural Patterns**  
Architectural considerations designed specifically for agentic AI.

**Mitigation Strategies**  
Concrete strategies for addressing common agentic threats.

**Development Lifecycle Guidance**  
Security considerations across all stages: design, build, deploy, and operate.

### Component-Specific Security

Detailed guidance for securing key components:

- **LLMs (Large Language Models)**  
  Security controls for the cognitive engine of your agent.

- **Orchestration Frameworks**  
  Securing control flow and decision-making mechanisms.

- **Memory and State Management**  
  Protecting short-term and long-term context storage.

- **Tools/Functions**  
  Securing code execution, external APIs, and tool integrations.

- **Operational Environments**  
  Security for agent interactions with external systems.

### Architectural Examples

Practical examples demonstrating security principles in different agentic architectures:
