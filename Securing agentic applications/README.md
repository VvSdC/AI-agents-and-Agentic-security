# 🛡️ Securing Agentic Applications - Implementation Guide

## 📖 Introduction

This repository is dedicated to providing **practical and actionable guidance** for designing, developing, and deploying **secure agentic applications** powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

It serves as a technical complement to the official **OWASP Agentic AI Threats and Mitigations (ASI T&M)** document, focusing on concrete technical recommendations and implementable security controls that builders and defenders can apply directly.
