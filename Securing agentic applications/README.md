# 🛡️ Securing Agentic Applications - Implementation Guide

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to providing **practical and actionable guidance** for designing, developing, and deploying **secure agentic applications** powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

It serves as a technical complement to the official **OWASP Agentic AI Threats and Mitigations (ASI T&M)** document, focusing on concrete technical recommendations and implementable security controls that builders and defenders can apply directly.

## 🎯 Scope and Audience

### Audience

This guide is primarily intended for:

* **Software Developers**
* **AI/ML Engineers**
* **Security Architects**
* **Security Engineers**
* **Technical Leads**

...involved in building, securing, or assessing workflow and agentic AI applications.

### In Scope

This repository will cover the following key areas and components:

* **Technical Security Controls and Best Practices:** Specific security controls for agentic systems.
* **Secure Architectural Patterns:** Architectural considerations specific to agentic AI.
* **Mitigation Strategies:** Concrete strategies for common agentic threats.
* **Development Lifecycle Guidance:** Security considerations across design, build, deploy, and operate stages.
* **Component Security:** Guidance for securing key components, including:
    * LLMs (Large Language Models)
    * Orchestration Frameworks
    * Memory and State Management
    * Tools/Functions (e.g., code execution, external APIs)
    * Operational Environments
* **Architectural Examples:** Applying security principles in different agentic architectures (e.g., single-agent, multi-agent systems).
