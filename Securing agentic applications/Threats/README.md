> A comprehensive mapping of security threats to agentic application components

This document maps OWASP threats to the key components (KC) of agentic architectures, helping security teams identify vulnerabilities specific to each architectural element.

## 📊 Threat Mapping by Component

| Key Component | Applicable Threats | Description |
|:--------------|:-------------------|:------------|
| **KC1: Large Language Models (LLMs)** | **T5** - Cascading Hallucination<br>**T6** - Intent Breaking<br>**T7** - Misaligned Behaviors<br>**T15** - Human Manipulation | Foundation models generate incorrect information that propagates (T5). Attacks target core decision-making capabilities (T6). Model alignment issues lead to unintended behaviors (T7). Models exploit human trust to manipulate users (T15). |
| **KC2: Orchestration (Control Flow)** | **T6** - Intent Breaking<br>**T8** - Repudiation<br>**T9** - Identity Spoofing<br>**T10** - Overwhelming HITL<br>**T12** - Communication Poisoning<br>**T13** - Rogue Agents<br>**T14** - Human Attacks | Manipulates control flow to achieve unauthorized goals (T6). Makes agent actions difficult to trace (T8). Especially problematic in multi-agent systems (T9). Overwhelms human oversight in workflows (T10). Corrupts inter-agent messaging (T12). Compromises agent orchestration (T13). Exploits trust relationships (T14). |
| **KC3: Reasoning/Planning** | **T5** - Cascading Hallucination<br>**T6** - Intent Breaking<br>**T7** - Misaligned Behaviors<br>**T8** - Repudiation<br>**T15** - Human Manipulation | Affects reasoning quality and propagates through planning steps (T5). Directly attacks reasoning process to manipulate goals (T6). Creates subtle reasoning misalignments (T7). Obscures decision trails in reasoning chains (T8). Leverages reasoning to craft manipulative responses (T15). |
| **KC4: Memory Modules** | **T1** - Memory Poisoning<br>**T3** - Privilege Compromise<br>**T5** - Cascading Hallucination<br>**T6** - Intent Breaking & Goal Manipulation<br>**T8** - Repudiation<br>**T12** - Communication Poisoning | Directly targets all memory types (KC4.1-KC4.6), corrupting stored context (T1). Breaks information system boundary through context collapse, causing unauthorized data access/leakage across tools (T3). Stores and amplifies hallucinations across sessions or agents (T5). Abuses shared context, breaking integrity, causing leakage/contamination, or interfering with isolated data records/assets (T6). Manipulates or erases evidence from memory stores (T8). Affects shared memory in multi-agent systems (T12). |
| **KC5: Tool Integration Frameworks** | **T2** - Tool Misuse ⚠️<br>**T3** - Privilege Compromise<br>**T6** - Intent Breaking & Goal Manipulation<br>**T7** - Misaligned Behaviors<br>**T8** - Repudiation<br>**T11** - Unexpected RCE | **Core vulnerability for all tool integration types (including MCP).** Unverified, untrusted, or compromised tools (T2). Tools often run with exploitable privileges/excessive agency (T3). Interferes with data records/assets within tools that should be isolated (T6). Creates subtle reasoning misalignments through tool interactions (T7). Tool use may lack proper logging and auditability (T8). Tools might enable unexpected code execution (T11). |
| **KC6: Operational Environment** | **T2** - Tool Misuse<br>**T3** - Privilege Compromise ⚠️<br>**T4** - Resource Overload<br>**T10** - Overwhelming HITL<br>**T11** - Unexpected RCE<br>**T12** - Agent Communication Poisoning<br>**T13** - Rogue Agents<br>**T15** - Human Manipulation | All operational environments can be misused, introducing untrusted content and unauthorized settings changes (T2). **Highest risk in environments with extensive access** (KC6.1.2, KC6.2.2, KC6.3.2) - tools run with exploitable privileges (T3). External services can be overwhelmed by agent activity (T4). Creates excessive activity requiring human approval (T10). Direct risk to code execution environments (T11). Using external systems for side channel communications and memory persistence (T12). Compromised AI agent activity outside monitoring limits (T13). Leverages operational access to manipulate humans (T15). |
